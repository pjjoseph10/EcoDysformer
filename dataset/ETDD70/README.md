# ETDD70: Eye-Tracking Dyslexia Dataset


## Description
This repository contains the ETDD70 (Eye-Tracking Dyslexia Dataset), a novel dataset collected to facilitate research in AI-based classification of dyslexia using eye-tracking data. The dataset comprises eye-tracking recordings from 70 Czech participants (35 dyslexic and 35 non-dyslexic) aged 9-10 years, captured during three text-reading tasks in the Czech language: syllables reading, meaningful-text reading, and pseudo-text reading.

## Key features of the dataset:

1. High-frequency (250 Hz) time series of 2D eye movement positions
2. Derived characteristics extracted from eye movement patterns
3. Data from 70 Czech participants (35 dyslexic, 35 non-dyslexic)
4. Three distinct reading tasks in Czech (syllables reading, natural reading, pseudo-text reading)

## The repository includes:

1. Raw eye-tracking data
	- *_raw.csv 
	
2. Processed data files:

	- *_fixations.csv: Fixation data detected using the i2mc algorithm
	- *_saccades.csv: Saccade data derived from consecutive fixations
	- *_metrics.csv: Derived statistical characteristics (see below for more information)
 
3. Stimuli data files:
	- *_rois.csv: Region of Interests (ROI): word and line boundaries
	- *_.jpg: Images of Stimuli

4. Dyslexia Label:
	- dyslexia_class_label.csv

5. Visual-based representations:
	- fixation_images.zip

## Characteristics provided:

	- Whole-task characteristics (e.g., number of fixations, saccades, regressions)
	- Region-of-interest (ROI) characteristics at the word level (e.g., dwell time, number of revisits)

This dataset supports research in AI-based methods for dyslexia classification, with a focus on Czech-speaking children. It has potential applications in improving diagnostic accuracy and early intervention strategies for dyslexia in Czech-language contexts. The best model trained on this data achieved an accuracy of around 90% in distinguishing between dyslexic and non-dyslexic individuals.
